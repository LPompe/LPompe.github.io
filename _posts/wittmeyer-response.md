# Veganism has never been about personal choice

## A response to: "I Admire Vegetarians. It’s a Choice I Won’t Ever Make." by Alicia P.Q. Wittmeyer - New York Times - 15/02/2020

When I first read the title of Ms. Wittmeyer's opinion piece, it didn't motivate me to read the article. My first thoughts - "Just another meat-eater digging in their heels" - are all too familiar, and are the callous response to the many cases of mockery I've experienced since turning vegan. "Do you know how much olives suffer?", "You're a joke of a man". Then the article kept popping up on my social media, and I realised that this cause - like most - might benefit from a little more civil discourse. So on a slow tuesday afternoon I submitted an experiment to keep my computer busy for the next hour and I sat down to read Ms. Wittmeyer's article. Where I was expecting to find another superficial argument, I found a thesis that resonated deeply with me. Here is my response.

Ms. Wittmeyer's opinion revolves almost entirely around a single argument: stopping consumption of meat will cause a loss of a large part of her identity. She is right, ofcourse. Food is a major component of every culture, and changing that in any way will invariably cause a change in identity. Yet it is all too easy to forget that this identity comes at a cost.

Before I get into the meat (substitute) of my argument, I want to acknowledge the white priviledge that Ms. Wittmeyer adresses. She says: [LOOK UP EXACT WORDS] "vegetarianism is white priviledge". Again, she is right. In the western world it is increasingly easy to turn vegan, and our individualist cultures emphasize the importance of personal choice. I am lucky enough to live in the first country to implement [constitutional rights for animals](https://www.afgoetschel.com/de/downloads/legal-situation-of-animals-in-switzerland.pdf), I have lunch with my labmates at a cafeteria that guarantees a different vegan option every day, the university even runs an entirely vegetarian restaurant that requires bookings to be made far in advance. So seemingly, being vegan is easily done. But it is not. Ms. Wittmeyer describes her cultural...

My family has strong Dutch <em>and</em> French components [DIFFERENT WORD], so naturally cheese has always been part of our identity. Many winter holidays were spent dusting off the raclette grill, cutting the cheese, fishing cornichons out of the vinegar, and plating the proscuitto. Last year, instead of preparing our assortment of grease, me and my mother made a vegan christmas dinner: flatbread with an assortment of homemade vegan cheeses, pumpkin risotto and a coconut cheesecake. We had a wonderful dinner, but it did not feel the same as our traditional raclette-fest. Cheese - still not even approximated by it's plant-based alternative - was part of a previous Identity that no longer exists, and - as Ms. Wittmeyer realised - giving up part of one's identity is never easy.

So why turn vegan? Because I have a moral obligation. I am morally obligated to stop contributing to the killing of animals for my entertainment. That's right: entertainment. We have stopped eating animal products for our survival a long time ago and we know [we can get all of our essential nutrients from plants](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19562864). So the only remaining reason for eating animals is cultural or the entertainment of our tastebuds.



Would it be okay to torture an animal if that made them taste better? How about if I killed - but didn't eat - a baby pig, because it's fun? What about if either of these scenarios was some sort of [cultural ritual](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/11/not-ashamed-dolphin-hunters-of-taiji-break-silence-over-film-the-cove)?
Some things are just not okay, and adding them to a menu does not change that.


She should be aware that modern agriculture is - for more than 99% - far beyond the idealised scenario where the animal doesn't feel any pain. [All animals in this system suffer](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/sep/25/industrial-farming-one-worst-crimes-history-ethical-question), and the [numbers are staggering](https://thevegancalculator.com/animal-slaughter/).

So when Ms. Wittmeyer argues that modernity allows her family to


It is this modernity that alows us to move beyond a culture that is inherently intertwined with suffering.
